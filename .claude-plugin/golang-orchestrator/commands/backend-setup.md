# Backend Setup Guidance

This plugin provides guidance and reference documentation for building production-ready Golang backends using the Echo Router framework.

## Available Skills

This plugin includes two valuable skills for backend development:

1. **effective-go** - Golang best practices and architecture patterns
   - Package organization and project structure
   - Error handling and custom error types
   - Concurrency patterns and goroutine management
   - Testing strategies and conventions
   - Dependency injection and configuration management

2. **echo-router-skill** - Echo framework HTTP routing and middleware
   - Server setup and configuration
   - Route definitions and grouped routes
   - Middleware chains and ordering
   - Request validation and binding
   - Authentication and authorization patterns
   - CORS and security headers

## How to Use These Skills

Use the `/effective-go` skill when designing your Golang backend architecture and need guidance on:
- Project structure and package organization
- Error handling patterns
- Concurrency and goroutines
- Testing conventions
- Configuration management
- Dependency injection

Use the `/echo-router-skill` skill when implementing HTTP routing and need guidance on:
- Setting up an Echo server
- Defining routes and route groups
- Building middleware stacks
- Request validation and binding
- Authentication middleware
- Error handling and recovery

## Development Workflow

1. **Design Your Architecture** - Use the effective-go skill to plan your backend structure
2. **Implement HTTP Routing** - Use the echo-router-skill skill to set up your routes and middleware
3. **Reference as Needed** - Return to either skill for implementation details and best practices
